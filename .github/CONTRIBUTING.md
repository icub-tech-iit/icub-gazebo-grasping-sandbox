Contributing to the Sandbox                                             {#contributing}
===========================

🌿 We accept contributions via [forks and pull-requests](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking) to address fixes and tiny modifications.

⚠ This sandbox is meant to showcase just a simple experiment. Thus, we will not accept additions that modify the present structure as this will very likely overcomplicate the code, making it less instructive for those who want to learn the basics.

👍🏻 Instead, if you happen to build on this codebase and want us to advertise your solution, we will be very happy to do so! Let us hear your voice by [opening up a PR on this](../../../edit/master/docs/building-on-sandbox.md). Take a look at the [list of works](https://robotology.github.io/icub-gazebo-grasping-sandbox/building-on-sandbox.html) we currently advertise.
